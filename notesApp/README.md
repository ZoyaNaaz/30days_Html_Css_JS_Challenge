## Notes App Using Html, CSS, JavaScript

This Project is the part of 30days JavaScript challange started from 01-Dec-2023.

Day-07

### Html

I used semantic html and learn about
contenteditable="true" attribute.

### CSS

While styling this page, I used absolute unit -- px. and % in some cases.

I learn about the  properties while creating this notes app.

### Javascript

In this JavaScript Project I am using Local Storage  that will store the notes list in web browser, So that if you close and restart the browser then also it will display your saved notes.
