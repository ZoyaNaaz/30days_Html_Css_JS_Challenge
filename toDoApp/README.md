## ToDO list App Using Html, CSS, JavaScript

This Project is the part of 30days JavaScript challange started from 01-Dec-2023.

Day-03

### Html

I used semantic html and learn about manipulating html using JS

### CSS

While styling this page, I used absolute unit -- px. and % in some cases.

I learn about the background Image property and associated property in depth while creating this ToDo list app.

### Javascript

In this JavaScript Project I am using Local Storage  that will store the task list or To Do list in web browser, So that if you close and restart the browser then also it will display your saved To-Do List

## Description
In this To Do list we can add our task list and mark that task as completed or incomplete. We can write the new task in the input box and click on the "Add" button then the new task will be added to the list.
We can click on the task name to mark it as completed or incomplete task. We will add a close icon to delete the particular task from the ToDo list.
