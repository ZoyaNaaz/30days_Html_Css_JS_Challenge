## Weather App Using Html, CSS, JavaScript

This Project is the part of 30days JavaScript challange started from 01-Dec-2023.

Day-01

### Html

I used semantic html and learn about the input attribute called spellcheck = false

### CSS

While styling this page, I used absolute unit -- px. and % in some cases.

I learn about the outline property and box-sizing property in depth while creating this weather app.

### Javascript

In JS I applied the concept of async await function and learn about fetch() API.

I also learn how to fetch data from api and use it in website.

Overall, Day_01 is successful! with commendable learnings.
